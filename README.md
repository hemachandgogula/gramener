A job Excercise
This is a priliminary Excercise for job in Gramener I found this as an interesting and I Have Completed this up to my level.They have given certain amount of data on Indian-state-census and asked to simlify accordingly as below
1. Create a geographic map of states with low literacy rates.
2. Find out most similar districts in Bihar and Tamil Nadu. Similarity can be based on any of
the columns from the data.
3. How does the mobile penetration vary in regions (districts or states) with high or low
agricultural workers?
Accordingly I attempted them as:
1:I have taken the data in gramener-usecase-census.7z and as they are asked to provide the data regarding literacy rate I have taken the 
population,male_literacy and female_litaracy paramaters.I used the formulas of Excel sheet to add total_litaracy and finally the percentage of literacy from total_literacy and population of each of the states.I reffered the websites for geographical representation of data and Then with the usage of template in internet the data of geographical map is replaced with the simplified data and the required geographical map is formed. The variation is shown in colors like from red to green(low to high). 
2:I have taken the given states(bihar and tamilnadu) by using the Advanced pivot tables from the given data and arranged acccordingly in other sheet and I tried to find the similarity in python but failed to do so and returned to the excel sheets with the tablular form of data and tried sorting the data with the population and some other parameters and Insered them in Bar charts and gone through that but found a little difficulty to attempt them in that way and finally I have Simplified the data into percentage and found the similar districts with Same Percentage of population in It.
3:As we are asked to find variation of mobile penetration I have taken the parameters of mobile and number of agricultural workers in that district directly into table and sorted them on agricultural_workers.Finally inserted the data into a line chart and made a variation graph in it.
All these Files are provided in Gramener_excercise_3_tasks_of_Indian_state_census.rar file and other files are given as a reference r addition files for the given task.
